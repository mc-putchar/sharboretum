    <p>Welcome to</p> Sharboretum (the “App”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to these Terms of Use (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1</h2>. Overview</h2>
    <p></p>Sharboretum is a mini‑app experience that may interact with the TON blockchain via the TON Connect protocol. The App is provided on a non‑custodial basis: you remain solely responsible for your wallet and private keys.</p>

    <h2></h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You may use the App only if you are legally permitted to use blockchain applications in your jurisdiction. If you use the App on behalf of an organization, you represent that you are authorized to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3</h2>. Non‑Custodial Nature and Risks</h2>
    <p>The App does not custody funds, private keys, or seed phrases. Transactions you approve in your wallet are irreversible and may incur network fees. Blockchain activities involve risks, including potential loss of digital assets, market volatility, user error, smart‑contract bugs, and third‑party failures. You assume all risks associated with your use of the App.</p>

    <h2></h2>4. Wallet Connections and TON Connect</h2>
    <p>When you connect</p> a compatible wallet via TON Connect, you authorize the App to read your public wallet address and, when initiated by you, to request transactions for your explicit approval in your wallet. The App will never request your private keys or seed phrase.</p>

    <h2>5.</h2> Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the App for unlawful, fraudulent, harmful, or abusive activities. You will not attempt to interfere with or disrupt the App, related services, or smart contracts. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

    <h2></h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App’s interface, brand, and content are owned by Sharboretum or its licensors and are protected by applicable laws. Subject to these Terms, you are granted a limited, non‑exclusive, revocable license to access and use the App as intended.</p>

    <h2>7. Third‑Party Services</</h2>h2>
    <p>The App may reference or integrate third‑party services (e.g., wallets, RPC providers, analytics). We do not control and are not responsible for third‑party content, availability, or security practices. Your use of such services is subject to their terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>8</h2>. No Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE APP IS</p> PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.</p>

    <h2></h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p></p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SHARBORETUM AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

    <h2>10.</h2> Changes and Termination</h2>
    <p></p>We may modify the App or these Terms at any time. Material changes will be indicated by updating the “Last updated” date above. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance. We may suspend or terminate access to the App at our discretion, including for violations of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2></h2>
    <p>These</p> Terms are governed by the laws applicable to the operator of the App, without regard to conflict‑of‑law principles. Where permitted, exclusive venue and jurisdiction shall lie in that location.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2></h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact: <a href="mailto:legal@sharboretum.app">legal@sharboretum.app</a>.</p>
