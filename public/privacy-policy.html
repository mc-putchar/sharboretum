      <p></p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Sharboretum (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects and uses information when you use the
        Sharboretum mini‑app experience (the “App”). By using the App, you consent to this Policy. If you do not agree,
        please do not use the App.
      </p>
      <p></p>
        Sharboretum integrates with the TON blockchain via TON Connect. We do not request or store private keys or seed phrases.

      <h2 id="collect">Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li</ul>>
          <strong>Wallet Information.</strong></strong> If you connect a wallet via TON Connect, we receive your public wallet
          address and basic connection metadata (e.g., wallet app name and network). Transaction approvals occur in your
          wallet; we never receive your private keys.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong</li>>App/Service Telemetry.</strong> Minimal technical logs (e.g., timestamps, request paths, coarse device
          information, error messages) necessary to operate, secure, and debug the App and its backend endpoints.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gameplay</li></strong>/Backend Data.</strong> If you interact with backend endpoints (e.g., “heartbeat”), we may store
          your public address and related game state required to provide App functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local</li></strong> Storage/Cookies.</strong> The App may use local storage or cookies for preferences, session
          continuity, and anti‑abuse measures. You may clear or block storage in your device settings; doing so may affect
          functionality.
        </li>
